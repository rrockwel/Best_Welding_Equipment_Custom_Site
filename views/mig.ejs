							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you need a welder to just work with on projects around the home, this welder might fit the bill for you. It’s the only welder that we reviewed that made our list and runs on <span class='emphasis'>120 Volt</span> input only. That means that you’re never going to run into a problem finding a power source where you need to be welding. On the other hand, though, it also means that you’re only going to get so much power out of this machine. This welder is going to max out at <span class='emphasis'>135 Amps</span>, making it one of the least powerful options. 
							</p>
							<p class="card-text text-left">
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along with the fact that it’s got a maximum of 135 Amps, the duty cycle on this welder is also a little bit lower than its counterparts. The duty cycle for the Eastwood MIG 135 is <span class='emphasis'>20% at 90 Amps</span>, which means it can run for 2 out of 10 minutes while at 90 Amps, and for less time as you crank up the Amps. 
							</p>
							<p class="card-text text-left">
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While this welder is less powerful than some of the others, and has a lower duty cycle, this also means that it won’t be able to handle quite as much, in terms of material thickness, as the other machines on our list. The Eastwood MIG 135 can MIG weld material between <span class='emphasis'>24 gauge</span> and <span class='emphasis'>12 gauge</span>. 
							</p>
							<p class="card-text text-left">
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don’t write off this welder, though, as it does very well on the material and thicknesses that it is rated for. If you know that you’re only going to be needing to do occasional welding on metals that fall within its range, it will handle them perfectly. Also, if you aren’t going to need the capability of welding continuously for long periods of time, this machine should work well for you. 
							</p>
							<p class="card-text text-left">
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plus, if you don’t need any of the frills that come with the more expensive machines and are just looking for a project/hobby welder, this one will definitely put a lot smaller of a dent in your wallet, as it is the <span class='emphasis'>least expensive</span> welder on our list.

							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lotos MIG 175 doesn’t have some of the extra features that come on welders like the <span class='emphasis'>PowerMIG 200</span>, but it will still help you get things done. While it doesn’t have the largest output range, it can still operate all the way up to <span class='emphasis'>175 Amps</span>, meaning you can still work all the way up to <span class='emphasis'>¼” material</span> and down to <span class='emphasis'>18 gauge</span> material. That means that you’ll be able to weld on the same thickness material as you would with the PowerMIG 200 or the Eastwood 135. 
							</p>
							<p class="card-text text-left">
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where this machine starts to lag somewhat behind it’s more expensive counterparts is with its duty cycle. It can operate at <span class='emphasis'>20% at 175 Amps</span> and <span class='emphasis'>30% at 135 Amps</span>, which doesn’t seem too low until you realize that this is while plugged into a 240 Volt input. Which brings us to another aspect that sets the Lotos MIG 175 apart from the others on the list: it is the only one that can only operate on <span class='emphasis'>240 Volt</span> input.
							</p>
							<p class="card-text text-left">
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact that it can only operate on 240 Volt may not be a problem for you, though, if you are used to working in a shop where you can bring your materials to your welder and not the other way around. Another reason you may want to consider moving your materials to your welding space if you are to go with this welder is the fact that it is the <span class='emphasis'>heaviest welder</span> on our list, weighing in at <span class='emphasis'>85 pounds</span>.
							</p>
							<p class="card-text text-left">
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, while this machine may not be best for someone who is needing to move their welder around a lot to work on different projects, or someone who needs to weld continuously, it is still worth considering if you just need a solid, dependable welder for the right price and without all the frills of the more expensive models.

							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little welder that could, the Everlast PowerMIG 200 only weighs <span class='emphasis'>35 pounds</span> and is the smallest, most compact welder that has made our list. Don’t let that fool you, though, as this is still an impressive machine. Like several others, it is a dual-voltage machine that can run off of both <span class='emphasis'>120 Volt</span> or <span class='emphasis'>240 Volt</span> inputs. Being both lightweight and dual-voltage is a big win as you can weld with it anywhere, and it’s not going to break your back getting it there.
							</p>
							<p class="card-text text-left">
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the fact that it is the lightest welder on the list, it also has the <span class='emphasis'>highest duty cycle</span>. It can run at <span class='emphasis'>60% at 100 Amps</span> with 120 Volt input and <span class='emphasis'>60% at 160 Amps</span> with 240 volt input. If you know you’re going to be working on projects that require a lot of continuous welding with fewer breaks, this might end up being the best option for you.
							</p>
							<p class="card-text text-left">
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another benefit of the PowerMIG 200 is that it’s built with their “Eurostyle quick coupler,” which means it’s easier to switch between guns, and even lets you use <span class='emphasis'>aftermarket MIG guns</span> rather than just the MIG guns made by Everlast. The welder is also well built like the Millermatic and Hobart Handler, featuring a <span class='emphasis'>cast aluminum drive assembly</span> that is just as sturdy as those on more expensive machines. 
							</p>
							<p class="card-text text-left">
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everlast also also a few little extra settings into this machine, as well. While you still have your standard Voltage and Wire Feed Speed settings, you also get Arc Force (Inductance) and Burn Back Control. <span class='emphasis'>Arc Force</span> lets you control the quality of the arc by changing how wet or stiff the arc feels. The <span class='emphasis'>Burn Back Control</span> lets you adjust how much stick out there is after you stop welding so you don’t have to constantly be snipping your wire to the length you want it every single time.

							<p class="card-text text-left">
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the best aspects of this welder is that it can run off of both 115 Volts and 230 Volts, meaning you can <span class='emphasis'>plug it in anywhere</span>. If you’re in the shop, you can work with the nice range that it provides in terms of voltage, and if you need to run next door to help your neighbor fix their fence, you won’t need to pull out that 100 foot 240 Volt extension cord that you don’t actually have. 
							</p>
							<p class="card-text text-left">
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another benefit of this welder is that it’s essentially a less expensive version of a <span class="emphasis">Miller welder</span>, featuring the same quality and performance, just without the Miller price tag. If you didn’t know, Illinois Tool Works purchased Miller Welding in 1993, and then proceeded to purchase Hobart in 1999. 
							</p>
							<p class="card-text text-left">
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The professional looking design is indicative of the quality that went into this welder, and that same quality that makes this a good looking welder is apparent on the inside, as well. While some welders in this price range look like a sheet metal box with cheap plastic parts inside, the Hobart Handler 210 MVP lives up to its name as MVP (MVP actually stands for Multi-Voltage Plug), utilizing quality parts like the <span class='emphasis'>cast aluminum drive assembly.</span>
							</p>
							<p class="card-text text-left">
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plus, it comes with a 3-groove drive roll that can be easily set up and adjusted (like the rest of the welder) without any tools required. And, if anything does end up going wrong, the whole machine is covered by Hobart’s <a href='https://www.hobartwelders.com/-/media/hobart/files/pdf/warranty.pdf' target='_blank'>5/3/1 Warranty</a>.
							</p>
							<p class="card-text text-left">
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While lots of welders in this price range come with a 6’ gun, the Hobart Handler 210 MVP comes with a <span class='emphasis'>10’ gun and 10’ working cable</span>. This makes it much easier to work on projects without having to move your machine around all the time. Unfortunately, that brings us to one of the few downsides of this welder. <span class='emphasis'>It is heavy</span>. At almost 80 pounds, it is one of the heaviest welders on our list and you probably won’t want to be lugging it around everywhere. At least without a cart. 
							</p>
							<p class="card-text text-left">
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One other factor to think about when considering this machine is the duty cycle. It’s got a <span class='emphasis'>30% duty cycle at 150 Amps</span>, which honestly isn’t that bad for welders of this size. But, if you know that you’re going to be working on projects where you’re going to be welding for long uninterrupted periods of time, you might want to look into a welder with a better duty cycle, like the <span class='emphasis'>Millermatic 211</span> or the <span class='emphasis'>Everlast PowerMIG 200</span>.

							<p class="card-text text-left">
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The <span class='emphasis'>Millermatic 211</span> is another welder on our list that works on both 120 Volt and 240 Volt input. It also has one of the <span class='emphasis'>best duty cycles</span> of the welders on our list. It can run <span class='emphasis'>40%</span> at 150 Amps on a 240 Volt input and <span class='emphasis'>20%</span> at 115 Amps on a 120 Volt input. Along with the Hobart Handler, it can also handle the biggest range of material thicknesses. It can run all the way from <span class='emphasis'>24 gauge</span> on a 120V input up to <span class='emphasis'>⅜ inch</span> on a 240 Volt input.  
							</p>
							<p class="card-text text-left">
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to being able to handle the biggest range of materials, the 211 also has the <span class='emphasis'>highest overall output range</span>, from 30 all the way up to 230 Amps for when you really need the heat. Since Miller no longer relies on transformer technology within this machine, but instead uses inverter technology, this machine remains quite portable at <span class='emphasis'>42 pounds</span>. That means your first project with it won’t have to be building the cart to lug it around on.
							</p>
							<p class="card-text text-left">
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the things that the 211 utilizes that many other more expensive welders utilize is an <span class='emphasis'>autoset function</span>. While using any of the other models on this list you will have to manually select your voltage and your amperage/wire feed speed. With this welder you are able to set your voltage, material type, and wire size and the machine does the rest for you. You can always manually set your voltage and wire feed speed manually, as well if the autoset isn’t working out for you on a particular weld. Plus, you won’t have to guess at the material thickness as they’ll send you a thickness gauge with the welder.
							</p>
							<p class="card-text text-left">
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along with the top-quality that you would expect from Miller, your machine will also be covered by their <a href='https://www.millerwelds.com/-/media/miller-electric/files/pdf/warranty/warranty.pdf?la=en' target='_blank'>True Blue 3 year warranty</a> if anything should go wrong. One of the only downsides to the Millermatic 211, and this is by no means a huge deal, is that it has the <span class='emphasis'>largest dimensions</span> of all of the welders on this list. The only other drawback is that it’s also got a higher price tag than the other welders. If you are looking for something with a smaller price tag and can survive without the autoset functionality of the Millermatic, the <span class='emphasis'>Hobart Handler 210 MVP</span> may better suit your needs.
