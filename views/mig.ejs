						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the best aspects of this welder is that it can run off of both 115 Volts and 230 Volts, meaning you can <span class='emphasis'>plug it in anywhere</span>. If you’re in the shop, you can work with this nice range that it provides in terms of voltage, and if you need to run next door to help your neighbor fix their fence, you won’t need to pull out that 100 foot extension cord that you don’t actually have. 
						</p>
						<p class="card-text text-left">
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another benefit of this welder is that it’s essentially a less expensive version of a Miller welder, featuring the same quality and performance, just without the Miller price tag. If you didn’t know, Illinois Tool Works purchased Miller Welding in 1993, and then proceeded to purchase Hobart in 1999. 
						</p>
						<p class="card-text text-left">
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The professional looking design is indicative of the quality that went into this welder, and that same quality that makes this a good looking welder is apparent on the inside, as well. While some welders in this price range look like a sheet metal box with cheap plastic parts inside, the Hobart Handler 210 MVP lives up to its name as MVP (MVP actually stands for Multi-Voltage Plug), utilizing quality parts like the cast aluminum wire drive system. 
						</p>
						<p class="card-text text-left">
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plus, it comes with a 3-groove drive roll that can be easily set up and adjusted (like the rest of the welder) without any tools required. And, if anything does end up going wrong, the whole machine is covered by Hobart’s 5/3/1 Warranty.
						</p>
						<p class="card-text text-left">
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While lots of welders in this price range come with a 6’ gun, the Hobart Handler 210 MVP comes with a 10’ gun and 10’ working cable. This makes it much easier to work on projects without having to move your machine around all the time. Unfortunately, that brings us to one of the few downsides of this welder. It is heavy. At almost 80 pounds, it is one of the heaviest welders on our list and you probably won’t want to be lugging it around everywhere. At least without a cart. 
						</p>
						<p class="card-text text-left">
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One other factor to think about when considering this machine is the duty cycle. It’s got a 30% duty cycle at 150 Amps, which honestly isn’t that bad for welders of this size. But, if you know that you’re going to be working on projects where you’re going to be welding for long periods of time, you might want to look into a welder with a better duty cycle, like the Millermatic 211 or the Everlast PowerMIG 200.
