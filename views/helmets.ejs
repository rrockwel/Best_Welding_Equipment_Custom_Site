						<h2 class="card-title">ESAB Savage A40</h2>.
						<p class="card-text text-left">
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right off the bat, we have to admit that this helmet has the smallest viewing field of all the helmets that made our list. At 7.7 square inches, it’s viewing area is 20% smaller than that of the ESAB Sentinel. At the same time, though, it is the lightest helmet that made the list. While we’re comparing it to the Sentinel, it is also rated at 1/1/1/2 (meaning there is some shading difference depending on the viewing angle), just like the Sentinel, but it generally rings in at less than half the price. Additionally, it doesn’t seem to suffer from some of the lens and sensor issues that the Sentinel can suffer from, depending on the environment you use it in.
						</p>
						<p class="card-text text-left">
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another benefit of the Savage A40 is the external grind button that also lets you adjust the shade without having to lift your hood. Finally, the Savage runs on solar just like the Sentinel, which can be a benefit or drawback depending on your situation. Either way, it’s something you’ll have to consider based on where you’re welding when taking into consideration the ESAB Savage and the ESAB Sentinel.
						</p>
						<p class="card-text text-left">
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, overall, the Savage is an absolutely amazing option at its price point. It is rated at the same level as the much more expensive Sentinel, but does have a much smaller viewing field. If you need to work on larger projects where you need to move and look around a lot, this might be an issue for you. If you tend to work on smaller projects, though, it might not. 
						</p>
						<p class="card-text text-left">
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This helmet also offers a low barrier to entry for those just getting into the field, such as welding students or those just starting their first job. If things don't end up working out, you won't break the bank with this option. If everything does work out (as I hope it does), this helmet may take you a ways, but you may have to upgrade at some point.</p>

						<h2 class="card-title">Miller Electric Digital Infinity Relic</h2>
						<p class="card-text text-left">
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first thing you’re going to notice when you put this helmet on is how much you’re able to see. This helmet has the largest viewing area of the helmets that made this list. And I’m not talking by a little bit. It’s viewing field is a whopping 13.4 square inches, making it 44% larger than both the ESAB Sentinel and the Lincoln Electric Viking! So, for anyone working on larger projects where you need to be able to see a lot, this might be the greatest benefit of the Miller Digital Infinity.
						</p>
						<p class="card-text text-left">
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few things about the Miller Digital Infinity that should be mentioned are that it comes with 5 outside cover lenses and 2 inside cover lenses and the headgear is a little different than the traditional headgear on a lot of helmets. 
						</p>
						<p class="card-text text-left">
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neither of these really seems to be a deal-maker or a deal-breaker. The headgear just depends on personal preference, while the extra lenses are nice but don’t have any effect on the real long-term functionality of the helmet.
						</p>
						<p class="card-text text-left">
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the downsides of this helmet is the amount of coverage on the sides of your head. It doesn’t cover your ears very well. This might be a problem if you often have to weld off to the side with your head in a tight spot. Otherwise, though, it might not be much of a problem considering the other benefits of this helmet.

						<a href='https://amzn.to/36KTSpq' target="_blank"><img class='card-img-top' src='./images/Safety/Helmets/ESAB_Sentinel_A_50.webp' alt='ESAB Sentinel A50' id="ESAB_Sentinel_A50_Image"></a>
						<h2 class="card-title">ESAB Sentinel A50</h2>
						<p class="card-text text-left">
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One thing that makes this helmet much different than the others is the shape of the main lens. It’s rounded and sits flush with the outside curve of the helmet, making it look great. It’s also functional in that it can help those “berries” bounce off that may otherwise start to build up in a traditionally shaped helmet with a recessed lens. This is great for overhead welding when you are welding straight on.</p>
						<p class='card-text text-left'>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, the curved lens can cause somewhat of a “fisheye” effect, making it difficult to accurately judge distances that are around the periphery of the viewing area. So, this may not be the best choice for someone who does a lot of welding with their head in a really tight area and needs to weld off to the side of their field of vision frequently. The sensors, unfortunately, are recessed and this can also cause issues with auto-darkening when working far off to the side.</p>
						<p class='card-text text-left'>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another drawback, for those used to working in tight spaces, at least, is the fact that the lens is not recessed at all and sits directly over your head when flipped up. While with a recessed lens helmet the plastic on either side may help mitigate any damage, on this helmet the lens will take the brunt of the impact. 
						</p>
						<p class="card-text text-left">
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, if you’re used to working in tight spaces, or not worrying when you tap your helmet on something overhead (it is a helmet, after all), this might not be the best choice for you. If, on the other hand, you do a lot of welding straight on, (and don’t hit your head often) this might work out as your favorite helmet so far.
						</p>
						<p class="card-text text-left">
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another factor that may affect your experience with this helmet is the True Color lenses. They definitely make things brighter and more clear, but may seem too bright for some people, especially anyone who has only used passive lenses.
						</p>
						<p class="card-text text-left">
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the best features of this helmet is the digital touch screen. It allows you to program in 8 different presets for different uses (e.g. if you switch between MIG and TIG) so you can just switch from one to the other, without having to fiddle with the settings to get them right. Plus, there's a hard hat adapter option so it can get strapped right to a hard hat, in case you need that functionality.</p>
						<p class="card-text text-left">
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite the issues some could have with this helmet while working in very tight spaces (consistent with the 2 rating for angle dependence), this helmet has great clarity, is super comfortable, and is a joy to use and wear.</p>

						<h2 class="card-title mt-2 mb-2">Miller Digital Elite</h2>
						<p class="card-text text-left">
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know, I know. This helmet doesn’t look nearly as cool as the Miller Digital Infintiy or the ESAB Sentinel. It’s true: it doesn’t. But it’s about how it works on the inside, not just how it looks from the outside, right? Right!? While it’s got a somewhat smaller viewing window than the Digital Infinty, it still measures 9.2 square inches, which is perfectly acceptable and about average for this list. It also features a more complicated headgear than the old traditional headgear, though it’s not the “3.4 Generation” headgear used in the Digital Infinity. Still, there are more adjustments and should allow you to get comfortable in this helmet.
						</p>
						<p class="card-text text-left">
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It also differs from the Digital Infinity in that the digital control panel doesn’t look quite as fancy on the Digital Elite, although it gives essentially the same functionality. In most respects, actually, the Digital Elite is actually very similar to the Digital Infinity. What sets it above and beyond, though, is that the shape gives you full coverage (no burns in your ear canals) while utilizing most of the same technology as the Infinity, but coming in at a lower price point. 
						</p>
						<p class="card-text text-left">
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, because of my own bias of functionality over fashion, this helmet ranks above the Infinity. If, on the other hand, you want a larger view window and a cooler aesthetic, as well as being able name-drop about your “3.4 Generation headgear,” you might decide to spend a few more bucks on the Digital Infinity.

						<a href='https://amzn.to/3iNm1ym' target="_blank"><img class='card-img-top' src='./images/Safety/Helmets/Lincoln_Electric_2450.webp' alt='Lincoln Electric Viking Welding Helmet' id="Lincoln_Electric_Viking_Welding_Helmet_Image"></a>
						<h2 class="card-title mt-2 mb-2 text-center">Lincoln Electric Viking</h2>
						<p class="card-text text-left">
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems clear why this helmet is the best: it is clear. It’s got a 1/1/1/1 rating, meaning that there is no shading difference caused by viewing angle like with the ESAB Sentinel and Savage. That will make this a great choice for those who are used to welding in tight areas where they can’t get a straight on view at what they’re welding. The Viking also has one of the fastest reaction times of the helmets on the list, nearly twice that of the Savage A40. 
						</p>
						<p class="card-text text-left">
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another advantage of the Viking 2450 Series helmet is the low-profile external grind button. Even if you do bump it against something while working, it’s not going to switch over into grind mode on you. Why? The button has to be held for 3 seconds to trigger it to switch over, preventing it from switching over when you don’t want it to. 
						</p>
						<p class="card-text text-left">
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The X6 headgear on the Viking 2450 is also extremely comfortable. It’s got a nice comfortable foam pad on the back, and the lock point is quite high, which keeps it out of your field of vision and from falling down.
						</p>
						<p class="card-text text-left"> 
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It also features the same technology as the Viking 3350 that improves performance both inside and outside, with the helmet basically being able to differentiate between your arc and sunlight. So, with its super comfy headgear, plus the superior clarity it provides, it has made it to the top of our list. Plus, it’s cheaper than all the others on the list, with the exception of the ESAB Savage.
