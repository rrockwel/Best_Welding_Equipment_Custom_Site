						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These gloves definitely give a lot of tactile feedback, which makes it easier to feel what you’re doing. They’re soft and flexible enough that they let you move your fingers easily, making them perfect for manipulating small objects. So, if you do any TIG welding, this might actually be better for a few other options on the list. They are also pretty long, which can be helpful if you’re not using leathers.
						</p>
						<p class='card-text text-left'>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One the downside, the fingers on these might feel a little short to some people. They also aren’t insulated so they only have mediocre protection from heat. So, depending on your needs, this might work for you due to their dexterity, but might not due to their lack of heat protection.

						<p class="card-text text-left">
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are the longest gloves on the list, and definitely allow you to do some (or a lot) of work without even wearing leathers. They are also thicker than expected, and do a good job in terms of heat protection. They’ve also got a nice liner which makes them super comfortable. 
						</p>
						<p class='card-text text-left'>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, these are the most expensive gloves that have made our list. The nice thickness that helps with heat protection also decreases dexterity a little bit, and so they might not be best for someone who needs to do a lot of TIG welding. Also, depending on the thickness of your forearms, the long sleeve on these might feel a little tight.

						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The biggest factor that got these gloves near the top of the list is their durability. They can last up to 6 months with full-time use. They also have a seamless index finger which gives a little bit more dexterity for manipulating small objects. They are also thick enough that you’ll have a hard time burning a hole in them. 
						</p>
						<p class='card-text text-left'>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although they are pretty thick, they don’t seem to be thick enough (or possibly have enough insulation) for overhead welding for any extended period of time. So, if you are used to working overhead, these might not be the best for you.

						<p class="card-text text-left">
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For being the cheapest gloves that made the list, they outstrip the Tillman gloves in their insulation and ability to be used for overhead without much problem. They also hold up just as well over time and don’t seem to be as marred with burn marks as other gloves. Also, the black lets them still look fresh after they’ve been used extensively. Plus, they’ve got flames if you’re into that look.
						</p>
						<p class='card-text text-left'>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the only drawbacks of these gloves is that, if you end up grabbing another pair of gloves and forget you aren’t wearing these, you might burn yourself when picking up ripping hot material. Seriously, though, they’re really good at protecting from the heat, even when picking up material that you probably shouldn’t pick up. Honestly, there are only a few things not to like about these gloves. For one, they might not fit well for those with smaller hands. They can also feel stiff due to how thick they are, so they can feel clumsy and probably aren’t suited for work where you need to have a lot of dexterity.

						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was tough to decide between these and the Lincoln Electric gloves. These ended up coming out on top because they provide a greater level of dexterity than the Lincolns, making them more versatile for different functions and styles of welding. This means that they can be used for TIG, which not all of the gloves on this list can live up to. They also provide an excellent amount of heat protection, even in the gloves of smaller sizes, which can sometimes be an issue for those with smaller hands. They also seem a little more durable than the other gloves on the list, and don’t seem to shrink as much with exposure to heat, even after 100+ hours of use.
						</p>
						<p class='card-text text-left'>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only problem with these gloves, and it might be nitpicky, is the fact that the liner seems to “shed” off onto your hands. So, when you take your hands out of these gloves, your hands might have some small pieces of fuzzy material on them. Besides that, though, there wasn’t much bad to say about these Revco gloves.
