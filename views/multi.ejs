							<p class="card-text text-left">
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We’ll get it right out of the way and start by telling you that this welder is <span class='emphasis'>120 Volt only</span>, which means you’re going to max out at <span class='emphasis'>140 Amps</span>. For most projects and for general hobbywork, though, this should be sufficient. But, if you know that you’re going to need more than that, rest assured that this is the only 120V-only welder on our list. On the plus side, this is the <span class='emphasis'>lightest</span> welder on our list as well. 
							</p>
							<p class='card-text text-left'>
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of usage, this welder is also best for MIG and Stick welding, though still perfectly capable of TIG welding. We only mention that it is best at MIG and Stick as the TIG is <span class='emphasis'>scratch-start</span> only, and unfortunately this machine doesn’t come with a TIG gun or foot pedal. You’ll have to pay separately for those. If you do opt for those extras, this machine can automatically detect when you plug in your foot pedal and you’ll be ready to go.
							</p>
							<p class='card-text text-left'>
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One way in which this welder differs from the others that made this list, besides being the most affordable, is the displays. While some of the other machines have a small digital screen that has multiple functions, the Lincoln LE31MP only comes with your <span class='emphasis'>basic two dials</span>, with one for Voltage/Amperage and the other for wire feed speed. So, while it’s definitely not as fancy as some of the other models, it won’t put as big of a dent in your wallet, either. 
							</p>
							<p class='card-text text-left'>
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As this welder is not as intuitive for novice welders due to the lack of a digital display that also helps to automatically choose settings, it may be just what you’re looking for if you only need it for smaller projects or if you don’t need to be welding very frequently. And, let’s be honest, it’s still made by Lincoln Electric.

							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, with a clear step up from the Lincoln LE31MP, is the ESAB Rebel EMP215IC. The first difference that brings it a spot above the Lincoln? It’s <span class='emphasis'>dual-voltage</span>, meaning it can run 120V input or 240V input, making it much more versatile. And giving it more heat and pumping out a maximum of <span class='emphasis'>200 Amps</span> as opposed to 140 Amps of the <span class='emphasis'>LE31</span>.
							</p>
							<p class='card-text text-left'>
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another advantage of the ESAB Rebel is that it contains a digital display (a benefit shared by the top 3 machines on our list). With the digital display come several apparent benefits, including easier set up and less time reading a chart when switching between different material thicknesses. All you need to do is select the process, wire size, material, and material thickness and the machine will pop out the <span class='emphasis'>best settings</span> based on what you’re doing, as well as the power input you’re using. 
							</p>
							<p class='card-text text-left'>
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another benefit of the display on this model is the fact that you can scroll right through the user manual, which is especially useful when you eventually need to purchase replacement parts, and get the part number that you need. This way, you don’t have to search for the paper manual that might be stuffed in the junk drawer at home. The display also lets you know, when you are switching processes, <span class='emphasis'>where everything needs to get plugged in</span> for you to be on your way, which can be helpful for occasional or novice welders. PLUS, the display can be set to multiple different languages!
							</p>
							<p class='card-text text-left'>
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One thing that the ESAB utilizes, that the others on the list don’t, is its <span class='emphasis'>roll-cage style design</span>. There are 5 thick, sturdy handles located around the machine which make it easier to carry, but also protect the display and other parts in the unfortunate event that your welder takes a tumble. 
							</p>
							<p class='card-text text-left'>
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the downsides of this machine is that the plastic connectors, both where the gun and foot pedal plugs in, are not as sturdy on some other machines and can be damaged easily. Another drawback is that the <span class='emphasis'>contact tips don’t screw in</span> like they do on most machines. The contact tips are basically held in by the shielding nozzle, which is fine… as long as you don’t need to do anything that involves welding without the shielding nozzle.

							<p class="card-text text-left">
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The PowerMIG 210 MP is a big jump up from its sibling on the list, the LE31MP, for various reasons. For one, the PowerMIG 210 MP boasts a <span class='emphasis'>fully digital display</span>, but keeps its operation and layout relatively simple, with 3 main knobs and 2 buttons to control inputs to the onboard computer. Once again, it encompasses essentially the same functionality of the other welders with digital displays and onboard computers, allowing you to input the different variables that apply to what you’re doing (e.g. material thickness) and sets you up with <span class='emphasis'>starting settings</span> that you can then adjust.
							</p>
							<p class='card-text text-left'>
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One thing that is different about the Lincoln, though, is that it makes it extremely easy for beginner or occasional welders by giving you a <span class='emphasis'>recommended range</span> to operate within. You can always adjust out of this range if you feel like it, and the machine will remind you that you’re outside of that range by displaying your selected parameter in red, rather than the green which is displayed when you’re in the range. The digital displays will also give you all the information you need about <span class='emphasis'>where everything needs to be plugged in</span> when switching between different processes, so you can stay focused on laying down nice beads.
							</p>
							<p class='card-text text-left'>
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that the main downside of this machine is that it is <span class='emphasis'>not as set-up for TIG</span> as it may seem at the start. For one, the machine doesn’t even come with a plug connector for a TIG foot pedal. You have to buy it separately and install it yourself, which can be quite a hassle.  Also, there aren’t separate input and output valves for your argon. This means that your TIG gun will receive gas <span class='emphasis'>straight from the regulator</span> without going through the machine, and also that you will need to control the gas flow from your gun. The TIG is also <span class='emphasis'>scratch-start</span> so this might not be the best option for someone who is planning on doing a lot of TIG welding, but might be better for someone who just occasionally needs to do some TIG welding.

							<p class="card-text text-left">
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Miller Multimatic 215 pushes ahead on this list because it can quite literally push ahead of the other welders. We’re talking about the fact that this welder can run at <span class='emphasis'>60% duty cycle off 120 Volts at 110 Amps</span>, which means it can run longer (and hotter) than the other machines that have made our list. Another big hit for the Multimatic 215 is the fact that it includes 2 gas input valves so you <span class='emphasis'>don’t have to switch your tanks</span> when you want to switch between processes. Instead of unhooking your 75/25 tank and dragging up a 100% argon tank and hooking that one up when you want to go to TIG, you can just leave them both there, hooked into the machine.
							</p>
							<p class='card-text text-left'>
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another benefit that we should mention is that the Multimatic 215 is another <span class='emphasis'>dual-voltage</span> machine that allows you to work with either a 120V or 240V power input.  Along with the fact that it’s dual-voltage, this welder also comes with a full digital display. Although the display is set up a little differently than the 3 dial set-up used by the ESAB Rebel, and is a little more complicated and has a few more buttons, it essentially performs the same function. It lets you put in your process, wire size, material, and thickness and then sets <span class='emphasis'>starting parameters</span> that you can then tweak to your liking. The display also comes with a transparent plastic cover which prevents the screen from getting accidentally scratched or cracked, which is pretty nice.
							</p>
							<p class='card-text text-left'>
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The digital display doesn’t have the depth of information offered by the Rebel, such as the entire manual with part numbers, but it does include a lot of the more basic information, such as <span class='emphasis'>how things need to be connected</span> for performing the different available processes. This can definitely be a great help to occasional or beginner welders, who might once in a while forget what needs to be switched to change, say, from MIG to TIG. 
							</p>
							<p class='card-text text-left'>
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While speaking about TIG, the Multimatic easily outstrips the PowerMIG 210. Instead of having to buy a plug for your foot pedal and spend over an hour to install it before even being able to use a TIG gun (without foot pedal control of your gas flow), the Multimatic is practically <span class='emphasis'>plug-and-play</span>. The foot pedal plugs in with what looks like an ethernet plug and you’re ready to go. On top of all this, it is a Miller welder, and is backed by their <a href='https://www.millerwelds.com/-/media/miller-electric/files/pdf/warranty/warranty.pdf?la=en' target="_blank">3 year True Blue warranty</a>.
